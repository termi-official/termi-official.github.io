					<p>
						My name is Dennis Ogiermann and I am a computer scientist specialized in the branch of computational cardiology within the area of scientific computing.
						Currently I am working at the <a href="http://www.lkm.rub.de/">chair of continuum mechanics</a> at the <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de">Ruhr-University Bochum</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Together with researchers from a multitude of disciplines I engage interesting and sometimes interdisciplinary problems from various scientific branches, ranging from computer graphics over biomechanics, biofabrication, robotics to computational medicine.
						Below I give a brief non-technical overview on some areas I engage, together with some motivation.
						However, to those who are interested in technical details, my main research areas are the development and investigation of <b>verified efficient numerical methods for time-dependent partial differential equations</b>, <b>scale-bridging validation of organ-level models in cardiology</b> and <b>software systems for distributed multiphysics problems on heterogeneous hardware</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						A more detailed description of my research can be found on the research page and in the blog.

				<h3>Computational Medicine</h3>
				<p>
					Some diseases are inherently hard to handle due to the complex interplay of different systems at different scales.
					Modeling and simulation allows an investigation of pathological mechanisms, which can be of outstanding help to develop therapies.

				<h3>Efficient Test-Driven Software Development</h3>
				<p>
					Efficiency in simulation software ca be seen twofold.
					On the one hand we want to be fast in development and on the other hand we want our developed software to be fast.

				<h3>Next-Gen Simulation Techniques</h3>
				<p>
					Many simulations systems have trendemous potential to be sped up.
					We often can increasing cache efficiency, clever data reusage, adaptivity, offloading or specialized solvers.

				<h3>Software Diagnostics</h3>
				<p>
					Modern software project's codebases range from a few thousand to multi-million lines.
					They all have a common natural predator: Bugs.
					Let's deal with them more systematically.

				<h3>Game Engine Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					People are reinventing the wheel on a daily basis when they develop games, while their complexity and cost tend to explode.
					We need a paradigm shift.
					Now!

				<h3>Theoretical Foundation</h3>
				<p>
					If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
					Whenever you look into software nowadays, hammers seem to had closeout sale over the last decade.
